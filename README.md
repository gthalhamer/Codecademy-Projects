# Ravenous React Project

In this multipart Codecademy project, I created a React app to search for restaurants using the Yelp API. 

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the key functions for this Yelp-clone:
  - Ability to search for and view restaurants based on business type and geographic location
  - Users can sort through restaurants using multiple filters
  - Restaurant information (name, location, cusine type, rating, reviews) are visible to user
  

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Web Development career path: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development.
